This application is designed to analyze DNA sequences and identify matches based on a given dataset. The library reads DNA patterns from a file and compares them with a target DNA sequence to find potential matches.

Features:
- String Multiplication (MultiplyStringByInt): Repeats a given string a specified number of times.
- DNA Search (FindStr): Searches for DNA sequences in a target DNA strand and identifies matching profiles.
- File Reader (ReadFile): Reads a file containing DNA profiles and formats it for processing.
- Equality Check (Equals): Compares numeric values in two vectors of strings to determine equality.
